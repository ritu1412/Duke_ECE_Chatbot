Structuring materials and particles at the tiniest of scales can imbue them with unique optical, electronic or mechanical propertiesâ€”engineers in Duke ECE are making them stimuli-responsive, antimicrobial and superhydrophilic, for example. We are also working to create self-assembling electronic devices and printed biosensors, and exploring the potential of novel electronic materials and films to enable next-generation solar cells, infrared photodetectors, photo-electro chemical cells and superconductors.
