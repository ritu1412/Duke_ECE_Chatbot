Efficiency of such structures & algorithms compared via Big-O analysis. Students learn multi-threaded programming. Emphasis on defensive coding, and use of standard UNIX development tools in preparation for students' entry into real world software development jobs. Strong C programming skills required to enroll. Those without such skills should take Electrical and Computer Engineering 551D instead. Instructor consent required. Not open to students who have taken or are currently taking Electrical and Computer Engineering 551D. Instructors: Hilton or Lipp
 ECE 784LA: Sound in the Sea: Introduction to Marine Bioacoustics. Fundamentals marine bioacoustics with focus on current literature and conservation issues. Topics include: intro acoustics; acoustic analysis methods and quantitative tools; production/recording of sound; ocean noise; propagation theory; active/passive acoustics; hearing, sound production and communication in marine organisms, potential impacts of anthropogenic noise; and regulation of marine sound. Lab focus on methodologies for generating, recording and analyzing marine sounds. Grad students responsible for additional acoustic analyses and results prep for student projects plus preparation additional lit review/critique. Taught in Beaufort at Duke Marine Lab. Prerequisite: AP or introductory biology or consent; Physics 41L or 161L (or equivalent) or consent. Instructor: Nowacek 

ECE 891: Internship. Student gains practical electrical and computer engineering experience by taking a job in industry and writing a report about this experience. May be repeated with consent of the advisor and the director of graduate studies. A full-time internship is available to ECE graduate students if it allows them to gain practical experience in a work environment related to their academic training and enhances their overall academic experience and, for students on F-1 Visa, their employment prospects once they return to their home country. Requires prior consent from the student's advisor and from the director of graduate studies. Credit/no credit grading only. Instructors: Various
 
ECE 899: Special Readings in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Special individual readings in a specified area of study in electrical engineering. Approval of director of graduate studies required. Instructors: Various
