Areas of Concentration
BREADCRUMB
Home Undergraduate Degrees
ECE majors must select a minimum of four upper-level courses from the departmental Areas of Concentration
To provide depth, at least two of these courses must be selected from the same area. To provide breadth, courses from at least two different areas must be chosen.
Students who elect to complete a more in-depth pathway in Machine Learning can earn a Concentration in Machine Learning designation on their transcript.
For students expecting to enter the engineering profession after graduation, a two-course or three-course sequence prepares the student for professional work in that area of concentration
For all students, including those expecting to enter fields such as medicine, law, or business management, these upper-level courses reinforce the broad relevance of the powerful problem-solving methodologies of engineering and illuminate enabling technologies for breathtaking applications of technology
IMPORTANT NOTES
Some concentration areas have a foundation course identified in bold
If two (2) or more courses are taken in such a Concentration Area, the Foundation Course for that area must be taken
In the lists below, prerequisite courses are indicated by square brackets: [...]
