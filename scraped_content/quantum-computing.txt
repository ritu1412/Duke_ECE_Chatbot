With $80+ million in funding from IARPA, ARO, NSF and DOE to date, Duke ECE’s internationally recognized quantum computing team—part of the Duke Quantum Center—is replacing the bits of traditional computers with trapped ion qubits, which exist in multiple states at once. These powerful new systems have the potential to perform multitudes of computations in quantum superposition, enabling algorithmic shortcuts for blazing-fast computation. The future holds promise for applications in cybersecurity, AI, and modeling complex biological, chemical, pharmacological, environmental and financial systems.
