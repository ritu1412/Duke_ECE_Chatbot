Close collaborations with industry and government partners drive Duke ECEâ€™s work to secure systems in the Cloud, on the ground and in the air. Our faculty include internationally recognized specialists in human-machine interaction, whose expertise is regularly sought by policymakers and industry to inform safety considerations for self-driving cars and other autonomous systems, and experts in resilient integrated circuit/system design and software reliability. Among our many research endeavors are machine learning techniques to predict security vulnerabilities, efficient countermeasures that enable embedded systems and microfluidic biochips to detect and resist attacks, and breakthroughs that secure machine learning hardware and AI accelerators. Our faculty lead Air Force University Centers of Excellence on assured autonomy and on communications networks in contested environments.
