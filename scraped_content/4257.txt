PRESENTER
Engineering Faculty Council
All Duke Engineering staff and faculty are invited to this meeting, which will include Dean Lynch's annual State of the School address.

The meeting will also feature an address by our provost and Pratt School of Engineering faculty colleague, Alec Gallimore.

Finally, the meeting will feature a presentation by Karis Boyd-Sinkler, Director of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Community for the Pratt School of Engineering.

The addresses are open to both faculty members and staff members, space permitting.

Box lunches will be provided. Please RSVP before April 4, 2024, so that we can plan.

Use your Duke email address to RSVP at: https://forms.office.com/r/eTizE1uSsG

Since this meeting is also the Pratt Faculty Meeting mandated by our bylaws, we will conclude with a faculty-only portion. Faculty, please submit items of interest by email to Volker Blum by April 4, 2024.
