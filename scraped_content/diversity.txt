Duke Electrical and Computer Engineering is dedicated to inclusive excellence
Working hand in hand with DEIC representatives from across Duke's Pratt School of Engineering, Duke ECE offers many resources and opportunities to students from underrepresented groups—from dedicated student organizations to recruiting incentives and fellowships, and events and activities that celebrate the diversity of our entire community.
Duke ECE regularly hosts action forums to discuss department policies and practices, in order to ensure that these areas continue to evolve with input from the engineering community.

An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States
BY ROXANNE DUNBAR-ORTIZ
The centuries-long genocidal program of the US settler-colonial regimen was largely ignored until historian and activist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz. Dunbar-Ortiz's history of the United States is told from the perspective of Indigenous peoples and reveals how Native Americans, for centuries, actively resisted expansion of the US empire.
This bottom-up peoples' history won a 2015 PEN Oakland-Josephine Miles Award for Excellence in Literature.
