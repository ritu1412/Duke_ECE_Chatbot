Metamaterials
BREADCRUMB
Home Research
Duke ECE is home to world leaders in metamaterials and metasurfaces. Our faculty members demonstrated the world’s first negative refractive index metamaterial in 2000, and in 2006 a Duke ECE engineer invented a metamaterial “invisibility cloak” that renders objects undetectable at microwave frequencies. Currently, a $7.5 million DoD investment funds our proving ground for acoustic metamaterials, while eight companies—and counting—have grown from our research.
