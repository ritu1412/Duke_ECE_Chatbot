Minor in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
BREADCRUMB
Home Undergraduate Degrees
Complement your major with a minor in the field of ML/AI
The Minor in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence requires the completion of a minimum of five (5) technical courses.
This education offering is an outgrowth of Duke ECE's global research leadership in AI and machine learning.
To provide sufficient foundational breadth, three (3) courses are drawn from identified core areas fundamental to the discipline. Students tailor their course of study through selecting two (2) upper-level (300-level or above) focus courses

Important Notes
Courses that are used to fulfill the student’s major(s) may not be double-counted toward the minor
Courses with content substantially equivalent to courses in the student's major(s) may not be counted toward the minor
Students with credit for any of the Fundamental Courses (e.g., exact or equivalent course taken to satisfy a requirement of the major(s)) may substitute additional Upper-Level Focus courses from the approved list above. The Director of Undergraduate Studies in ECE must approve such exceptions.
At most, one Independent Study course (approved the DUS in ECE) may be used to fulfill one of the upper-level elective requirements.
PRE-REQUISITES
It is expected that a student pursuing a Minor in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence will satisfy all prerequisites for each course selected for their minor program.
This will typically involve completion of courses in Math, Statistics, and Computer Science, which are pre-requisites for the fundamental and elective courses.
Specifically, the following prerequisite knowledge is assumed:
Mid-level programming course (e.g., CS 201)
Linear algebra (e.g., Math 216, 218, 218D-2, 221)
Introductory statistics (e.g., EGR 238L, ECE 380, ECE 555, Stat/Math 230, Stat 240L)
Exceptions may be granted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies in ECE, for example, if a student’s preparation is deemed equivalent to the pre-requisite.
